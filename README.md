# Auto WebWork Study Helper (Local HTML)

This Chrome extension extracts the visible problem text and images, opens ChatGPT with a prefilled prompt, and **does not auto-send** when an image is detected so you can drag-drop the image manually.

## Setup
1. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
2. Click **Load unpacked** and select this folder.
5. Click **Send to ChatGPT** on the page.

## Behavior
- Detects problem text, options, and a single image.
- Opens the image in a new tab (once) if present.
- Prefills ChatGPT; if an image is detected you must drag-drop it and then press Enter/Send.
- After you send, the image tab closes automatically.
